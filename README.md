* **Logging and Auditing:**  Track changes made to employee data, program information, and workflow actions for auditing purposes.
* **Modularity and Scalability:** Design the system to be modular and scalable to accommodate future growth and changes in NDE processes.
* **Documentation:**  Maintain comprehensive documentation of the system, including user manuals, API documentation, and code comments. 
* **Agile Development:**  Use an iterative and incremental development approach (Agile) to allow for flexibility and incorporate feedback throughout the process.
